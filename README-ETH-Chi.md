# Temp Name: Empowering Generosity with Crypto

This is a team submission for ETHChicago 2023 Hackathon. With this project we aim to bridge the gap between the crypto naitive and those who need quick cash. 

## Features

- **Seamless Account Abstraction:** Users don't need to worry about complex crypto wallet setups. With our platform, a wallet is automatically created which they can access using familiar web2 methods such as email or social logins.

- **Gasless Transactions:** Our relayer ensures users don't have to fret over gas fees. We sponsor all transactions to make the process seamless.

- **Direct Crypto Transfers:** Crypto enthusiasts can directly send funds to users. Recipients can then easily cash out with their favorite off ramp.

- **API3 Integration for Price Conversions:** Real-time and accurate price conversions for fiat currencies. 

## How It Works

1. **Crypto User Sets Up Fund:** A crypto user sets up a fund to help out others.
2. **Send Money:** They send the desired amount in crypto.
3. **Recipient Notification:** The recipient gets notified of the received funds.
4. **Easy Cash Out:** Recipients can easily cash with any off ramp.
